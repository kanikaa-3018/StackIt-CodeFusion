3. **View & Answer (Screen¬†3)**
   - On Question Detail: view question, tags, author info.
   - Scroll through answers; vote (up/down) once per answer.
   - If not logged in, voting prompts login/signup.
   - Logged‚Äëin users submit answers via the Rich Text Editor.
   - Question owner can mark one answer as **Accepted**.

4. **Notifications**
   - Actions (answer, comment, mention) trigger real‚Äëtime updates via the bell icon.
